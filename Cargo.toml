[dev-dependencies]
# An older version of cpal, but newer versions depend on the futures library,
# which is incompatible with the version of Rust that Hound guarantees to
# support. We also need to pin the version of lazy_static -- a transitive
# dependency of cpal -- to a version that compiles with a non-nightly compiler.
cpal = "0.2.12"
lazy_static = "=0.2.0"

# TODO: enable this when sound_stream (or portaudio, actually) builds properly.
# sound_stream = "0.3.2"
